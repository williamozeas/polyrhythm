Game contains bright colors and flashing lights!

polyrhythm is a rhythm game about patterns, not precision. You control the left and right drums, which you will beat in time with the music.

There is no visual lead-up to each note - instead, take your time to learn each pattern before trying to play it. The music will not stop if you miss notes while learning.

An icon in the top right indicates whether the music is in a loop until you figure out the rhythm, or playing a linear section, during which you can try to hit notes or enjoy the show.
